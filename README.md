# intersight-jupyter-notebooks
Experimental collection of Cisco Intersight Jupyter notebooks that exercise the Intersight API's

## Requirements

Here are a few things you'll need to take advantage of the Jupyter Notebooks in this repository:

* You'll need Jupyter Notebook installed in your environment.
* Access to a Cisco Intersight account
* An Intersight API Key

## Jupyter notebook

Jupyter notebook is an interactive, web-based notebook for interactive computing. GitHub renders interactive Jupyter notebook files as static HTML files which means you can't run commands interactively directly from Git. Instead you can download the `*.ipynb` file to your local machine with Jupyter notebook installed and then use the interactive features.
